# Floating-Point-Unit-Xilinx-IP-Core
This project is a Floating Point Unit (FPU) implemented in VHDL using Xilinx Vivado. It supports IEEE 754 single-precision floating-point arithmetic, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The design uses an FSM-based control mechanism and AXI-Stream protocol for efficient data transfer.
